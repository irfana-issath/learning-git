                     <p>Defence minister Rajanth Singh on Thursday urged the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA to take charge of Pakistan's nuclear weapons, days after the nuclear-armed neighbours ended their worst military conflict in nearly three decades.<br>Rajnath Singh kick-started a crucial visit to Jammu and Kashmir to take stock of the overall security situation, especially along the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border.</p>
                     <p>“The world knows that our army's aim is accurate, and when they hit the target, they leave the counting to the enemy. How strong is India's pledge against terrorism today it can be known from the fact that we did not even care about their nuclear blackmail. </p>
                     <p>“The whole world has seen how irresponsibly Pakistan has threatened India. Today, from the land of Srinagar, I want to raise this question whether nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation. I believe that Pakistan's nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),” Rajnath Singh said while addressing Indian soldiers in Srinagar's Badami Bagh Cantonment.</p>

<p>Ravi began his note by claiming that watching people speculate about his personal life after his public appearance with Keneeshaa and Aarti’s statement has been ‘traumatic’. He wrote, “While our country faces a greater collective crisis, it pains me to see personal matters litigated in the court of public opinion. We should know better than this. Watching my private life turned into gossip, twisted without truth or compassion, has been deeply traumatic. My silence was not a weakness - it was survival. But when my integrity is questioned by those who don’t know my journey or my scars, I must speak.”</p>

<p>When a teenager Virat Kohli was asked about his favourite cricketer, he had no qualms in taking Herschelle Gibbs' name. Apart from his declaration of being a ‘quick bowler’, there was nothing to contest in that ICC U19 World Cup introductory video, which can be easily found on social media. 17 years later, as Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, his 'favourite cricketer', Gibbs made heads turn, not for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Often looked at with the corner of the eye for his flamboyance and inhibition-free thought process, Gibbs ruffled the fans of Virat Kohli by criticising his technique. The former South Africa batter, whose muscling of the fast bowlers was as famous as his notorious lifestyle off the field, said Rohit Sharma has a far better technique than Kohli.</p>
